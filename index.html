        <p style="font-family: Ariel; color: brown;">I'm Jimwell Cabanting Forteo i'm 20 Years Old living in Acacia Compound South GreenHeights Village Putatan Muntinlupa City my birthday is March 28, 2003. I'm the second oldest of my siblings now I'm studying at the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa 2nd Year in the course Bachelor of Science Computer Science and member of PLMUN Chorale</p>
        <p style="font-family: Ariel; color: brown;">I studied elementary at Soldiers Hills Elementary School I am batch 2015. I studied my High School at Muntinlupa National High School I am batch 2020. I went to Senior High School at Muntinlupa National High School I am batch 2022 and I studied college at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa which is 2nd Year College in Bachelor of Science Computer Science</p>
        <p style="font-family: Ariel; color: brown;">My hobbies is cycling, I became a cyclist because of the pandemic because we can't go out because we have a pandemic, we can't exercise anymore and because of the difficulty of transportation because I'm only a few drivers, I bought my father a bike at first for the sole purpose I bike to exercise but because of my friends I have been to places I have never been before. I can go to tagaytay, Antipolo, Lemery Batangas and different places that are far away so my being a cyclist is a big help because here I have fun and have many friends who join me on the rides.</p>
